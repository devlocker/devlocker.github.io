Humans are a curious lot. Developers are even more curious.

We love taking things apart, seeing how they work, forgetting what the fuck
we were even doing, losing a screw and never putting it back together.

It is just in our nature. It is what got us here in the first place.

Now, being curious is great, the hunger for knowledge that drives us is 
really important not only in our personal growth, but in our growth as a
community. We will continue to solve harder problems as we ask more questions.

The ultimate question is: "When do we stop asking questions and start making decisions".

The buck has to stop somewhere. The reason why you are curious has to have an
answer, but when is your curiosity satiated? When do you decide "I am done asking questions"?

You don't. It's against your nature.

At best you just ignore that their is another thing to ask, alternatively, 
you just become uninterested in the answer. This is terrifying. Apathy is the axe
that beheads our curiosity, our drive to learn and grow.

Now this is only truly terrifying if you aren't actively deciding not to care.
